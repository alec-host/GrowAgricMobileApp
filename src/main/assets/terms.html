4.4.1 The Sponsor acknowledges that, by investing in a Project, their Contribution may be utilized for the Project related activities and shall not be available for the Sponsor during the entire duration of the Project and the Company nor its Partners can or will refund the Sponsor’s Contribution until the successful completion of the Project.
4.4.2&nbsp; In the event that a Project is underfunded, the Company reserve the right to transfer the Sponsor’s Contribution&nbsp; to another farm that provides the same rate of return and will deliver returns within two (2) weeks of the Sponsor’s original expected payout date.

8.1 Access and use of the Platform shall, at all times, be subject to the terms and conditions which are available on the Platform.
8.2 The Company reserves the right to implement a system where secure access to the Platform is provided by way of a Sponsor’s username and password.

8.3 In the event that a secure access system has been deployed per Clause 8.2, the Sponsor agrees to keep their username and password secure at all times. The Company accepts no liability for losses incurred or investments made by a third party due to the Sponsor failing to keep their username and/or password secure.
8.4 In the event that a secure access system has been deployed per Clause 8.2, if the Sponsor suspects that their secure access to the Platform has been compromised in any way, it is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Company as soon as possible. This Clause does not affect the liability stance outlined in Clause 8.3.
8.5 Access to the Platform may be restricted at the discretion of the Company, particularly during periods of maintenance and upgrades. The Company agrees to keep such restrictions to the minimum required for operational reasons.&nbsp;
9. Limitations and Exclusions of Liability
9.1 Nothing in this Investment Contract Agreement shall:
9.1.1 limit or exclude the liability of a Party for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation by that Party;

10. Foreign Exchange Risk
10.1 The Sponsor’s Contribution, are denominated in the Contract Currency, and the Sponsor acknowledges and agrees to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.2 Every effort is made to ensure that the non-KES prices displayed on the Platform accurately reflect the current Kenyan Shillings (KES) cost of a Project. However, it is impossible to ensure that when a Contribution is made in a non-KES currency that the monies received by the Company will exactly correspond to the KES value of the Project. This results in small foreign exchange gains and losses for the Company. These are netted against each other (in KES, the functional currency of the Company) for a Project, and the Sponsor agrees to absorb any net loss arising.&nbsp;
10.3 Following the adjustment made in Clause 10.2, all subsequent financial calculations regarding a Project are made in the Contract Currency. The Return on Investment is calculated in the Contract Currency, and therefore any Project Payment attributable to a Sponsor will be an amount denominated in the Contract Currency. The Company cannot guarantee the foreign exchange rates that will be applied when using the Mode of Payment and take no responsibility for any loss by the Sponsor.&nbsp;

11.1 This Investment Contract Agreement is valid for one and every individual Investment Cycle as mentioned in Clause 0.1 and is considered to be in force until the date on which the Project Payment is made to the Sponsor.

11.3&nbsp; If the Sponsor wishes to terminate the Investment Contract Agreement before either of Clause 11.1 or 11.2 take effect, the penalty fee payable to the Company will be ten times the Contribution.&nbsp;
